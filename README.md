# Wolfenstein-like Game in C with DDA Algorithm

This project showcases a Wolfenstein-like game coded in C, utilizing a Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm for rendering graphics. The DDA algorithm, implemented from scratch in C, enables efficient rendering of graphics in real-time. The graphics rendering is facilitated by MinilibX, a lightweight graphics library designed for simple window creation and basic drawing operations.

## Overview

The Wolfenstein-like game immerses players in a 3D environment reminiscent of the classic first-person shooter. Players navigate through a maze-like structure, encountering obstacles and enemies along the way. The game leverages the DDA algorithm for raycasting, allowing for realistic rendering of walls and objects within the game world.

## Features

- **DDA Algorithm:** The game utilizes a custom implementation of the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm for raycasting. This algorithm efficiently calculates the intersection points of rays with walls in the game environment, enabling the rendering of 3D graphics.

- **Real-time Rendering:** The DDA algorithm enables real-time rendering of the game environment, providing players with a smooth and immersive gameplay experience.

- **MinilibX Integration:** MinilibX is integrated into the project for graphics rendering. This lightweight library simplifies window creation and basic drawing operations, allowing developers to focus on implementing game logic and mechanics.

## MinilibX Synopsis

MinilibX is a minimalistic graphics library designed for rendering simple graphics on screens without requiring knowledge of X-Window or Cocoa. It provides basic functionalities for window creation, drawing tools, image functions, and event management.
